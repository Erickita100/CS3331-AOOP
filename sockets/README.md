Server/Client Sockets

Compile both Server and Client classes.
First run the server file.
When you see that the server prints waiting for client, then proceed to run the Client file.
When the terminal prints client connected, then  type something to the server from the client terminal.

Typing "What time is it?", "Time?":
	Server will respond with the current time.
	
Typing "goodbye":
	Socket connection will terminate and program ends

Typing any other string:
	Server echos it back to the client.
